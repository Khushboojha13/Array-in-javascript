let arrsss=[10,20,30,40,50];
//swap 30 and 40- here we will use destructring method
//This is a far better method than anyone. This method can be executed in a single line. This swapping can be done by writing the 2 array elements and want to reverse in order and in square brackets on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, we will write the same array elements but this time in reverse order. We can also create a reusable function that can swap the specified index of the array.

//[a[m], a[n]] = [a[n], a[m]] 

//here Where m and n are the index numbers to swap

[arrsss[2],arrsss[3]]= [arrsss[3],arrsss[2]];
console.log(arrsss); //swapping done
